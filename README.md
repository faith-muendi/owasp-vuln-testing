# Web Application Vulnerability Testing

## 📌 Overview
A penetration testing project targeting OWASP Top 10 vulnerabilities using Burp Suite, OWASP ZAP, and custom test cases on intentionally vulnerable applications.

## 🛠 Tools Used
- Burp Suite
- OWASP ZAP
- DVWA (Damn Vulnerable Web App)
- Kali Linux

## ⚙️ Implementation Steps
1. Set up DVWA and other test apps in a controlled lab.
2. Used Burp Suite to intercept and manipulate requests.
3. Discovered vulnerabilities like:
   - Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)
   - SQL Injection (SQLi)
   - Insecure Login Forms
4. Created reports with identified issues and remediation steps.


## ✅ Key Learnings
- Developed hands-on skills in web application security testing.
- Understood how real-world attacks exploit vulnerable apps.
- Learned to use automated tools and manual techniques for vulnerability discovery.
